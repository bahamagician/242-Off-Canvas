#242 Off Canvas

242 Off Canvas is a responsive off-canvas navigation menu using CSS transforms & transitions. This project is a fork of the off-canvas navigation menu [Pushy](https://github.com/christophery/pushy).


##Modifications from Pushy

- Uses translateX instead of translate3d
- Additional styles for the body and html so it will play well with sticky objects
- Use Font Awesome for arrow icon instead of an image
